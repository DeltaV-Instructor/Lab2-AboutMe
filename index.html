                <h2>My name is Tyler Walker...</h2>
                <p>I am originally from Centerville, IA, and I currently live in West Des Moines, IA after moving back from Boulder, CO around 7 months ago. I have worked in horticulture for the past 8 years and am now hoping to transition into the tech industry.</p>

                <h2>Education History</h2>
                <p>I graduated high school in 2012, and began attending Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, IA that fall. I graduated after early from there in November 2013, and began attending the Univerisity of Iowa in January of 2014. I had a beautiful 2.5 years at Iowa before deciding I didn't know what I wanted to do, and decided to do a horticulture program at Indian Hills again. The rest is history.</p>

                <h2>Job Experience</h2>
                <p> During my horticulture program I interned at the Univerisity of Iowa Athletics and Iowa City Parks and Recreation, and worked there for a year after graduating. I then took my first full-time position in Glendale Colorado, being the turf manager for the profesional rugby stadiium Infinity Park. I worked there a year before moving to Boulder, where I worked at the City of Boulder Parks and Rec for the entirety I was there. I now work at R&R Realty where I do groundskeeping for their commercial properties.</p>

                <p>Complete my DeltaV Software Development program and obtain a position in the tech industry as a developer</p>
